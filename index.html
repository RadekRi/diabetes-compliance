<code>
> Hey John, Just checking is 5pm still the best time for your daily reminder?
<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  No, can you change that to 3pm please?
<br>
> Done! From tomorrow I'll remind you at 3pm. And did you take your medicine today?
<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; Yes
    <br>
> Good! In that case, let's play a game of pontoon. I've drawn us both two cards. You have a five of clubs, and a seven of hearts. And if you don't know the rules, let me know!
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;   How do you play pontoon?
<br>
> It's a simple game: The player whose cards add up nearest to 21 is the winner. If you have a total of more than 21 you 'bust': you lose. Each round, you get to 'twist' (get another card) or 'stick' (stay with what you have). So what do you want to do - 'stick' or 'twist'?
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;   Twist
<br>
> I'll let you know your card tomorrow!

> Hi John, it's that time again: did you take your medicine yet?
 <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes

> Excellent! In that case your new card is a four of hearts. So you now have a 5 clubs, 7 and 4 of hearts. Your total is 16. Do you want to 'twist' or 'stick'?
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  Twist

  &nbsp;&nbsp;    Yes

<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;   Something different please
<br>
> Would you like a quiz about diabetes, or an interactive story or something else entirely?
   <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;   Give me a quizz
<br>
> Ok, here it comes: How many types of diabetes are there? 1,2,3,4 or 5?
<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I think it there are two
<br>
> That is correct! Here is the full answer: There are two main types of diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes immune cells attack and destroy cells that produce insulin. In Type 2 diabetes the body does not produce enough insulin or does not react to insulin. In the UK around 90% of adults have Type 2 diabetes. 
<br>
> Do you want to find out more?
<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes
<br>
> There's lots more here: http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diabetes/Pages/Diabetes.aspx
<br>
> So Well done! You have scored another point. You can use your points to unlock extra features and play more games!
<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;How many points do I have?
<br>
> So far you have 7 points. Keep up the good work!
<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks
<br>
> Ok, I will be in touch again tomorrow to ask you about your medication. Let me know if I can help anytime.
<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Bye
<br>
> Have a good day!
